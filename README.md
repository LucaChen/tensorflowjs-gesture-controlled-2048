# Gesture controlled 2048 - TensorFlow.js Transfer Learning

Play 2048 using Convolutional Neural network trained on your browser.

I've used TensorFlow.js to build a gesture control mechanism for playing 2048. It uses a pretrained MobileNet model and train another model using an internal mobilenet activation to predict the movements.
